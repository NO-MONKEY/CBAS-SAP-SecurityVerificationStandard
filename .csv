Make sure you have knowledge and understanding of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) before moving forward.

The control illustrates how to configure the SAProuter to use SNC.

- Download and extract the CommonCryptoLib from SAP support portal

- Set the environment variable SNC_LIB = \<path to the CommonCryptoLib\>

- Set the environment variable SECUDIR = \<saprouter directory\>/sec

- Sign a certificate for your SAProuter through a Certificate Authority (CA) you trust or through SAP

- Generate your Personal Security Environment (PSE) files by running the following command where you placed your SAProuter files. *sapgenpse get_pse -v -a sha256WithRsaEncryption -s 2048 -r \<csrfile\> -p local.pse -x \<password\> ""CN=\<YOUR SPECIFIC CN\>""*. The \<csrfile\> is the file name of your choosing that will be used for your Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

- Submit the \<csrfile\> file to your Certificate Authority (CA) to receive the certificate to proceed

-  Copy content of the received certificate to a file on your SAProuter system and import with the following command *sapgenpse import_own_cert -c \<certca\> -r \<root CA certificate\> -p local.pse*. The \<certca\> is the file received from your CA and \<root CA certificate\> is the root certificate from the CA

- Generate the credentials file with the following command *sapgenpse seclogin -p local.pse \<pse password\>*

- Test to check whether everything is configured and installed correctly *sapgenpse get_my_name -v -n Issuer*

- Set an ACL in your saprouttab file to allow SNC connections

- Start the SAProuter using its SNC name

Testability of ABAP software implementations.

A central security concept in the SAP standard system is the separation of development, test and productive systems.
The test system plays an important role here. In the test system, the decision is made as to whether an application satisfies the requirements of the company. In this process, both functional and non-functional quality aspects of the application are checked. For a quality check to provide reliable results, it is not sufficient for the tester to have comprehensive expertise in the quality assurance field. The application itself must also be testable. This means that a tester can run the application for test purposes and that, in cases of doubt, the tester can analyse the source code of the application.

If specific functionality in an application cannot be run (by a tester) in the test system, the tester cannot determine whether it satisfies the quality requirements. In this case, unchecked code would be transferred to a productive system exposing unverified risk to the system.

1. The specification of the change includes a concise description of the authorization requirement adjustments according to the change.
2. As part of code change review process all custom code has to be checked to carry that:
  - All authorization checks using the SAP standard mechanisms. This typically means that, either:
    - the command AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT or
    - a module, which has been specially developed for checking a specific authorization (such as the SAP function module 'AUTHORITY_CHECK_DATASET'),
    - or an access declaration by the Data Access Control (DAC) language for Core Data Services (CDS) must be used.
  - All direct executable modules implement explicit access restrictions at the execution start checking on user permissions to start the module
  - Before the command CALL TRANSACTION is carried out, an authorization check should take place to ensure that the current user is actually authorized to start the transaction. In case a transaction is called with the attempt of only providing limited access to the transaction's functionality, for example with predefined selection values and the addition SKIP FIRST SCREEN it can be reasonable not to carry out an authorization check for user permissions of starting the transaction, as this may requires unnecessary high privileges for the user.
  - The implementation verifies the user's authorization as close as possible to the execution of the protected business function.
  - The implementation handles the result of the verification of user's authorizations to permit legitimate access and execution and prohibit other by the verification of return codes like sy-subrc and authorization exceptions according to the checks implementation.
", IY,"
Access & Authorization

ABAP uses a mostly explicit authorization model. This means that an authorization check only takes place if a program carries out the check explicitly itself. In other words: If there is no explicit authorization check in the code, there is no check as to whether a user is actually authorized.
In custom-developed code, authorization checks are frequently overlooked. This means that the authorization concept has no effect. This leads to compliance infringements, which can have serious consequences in the event of an audit. For this reason, it is critically important that authorization checks are carried out in custom developments by the programs themselves wherever necessary, and that all authorization checks are also correctly programmed from a formal perspective.
In addition to the lack of authorization checks, the structuring of program components can also influence the viability of the authorization concept. For example, you should query how executable modules are comprised under the assumption that interface authorizations are not, or can't be assigned granular for the exposed business functionality.
Authorization checks are typically the most frequent security error in ABAP custom developments.

    - it must not undermine the security mechanisms of the SAP standard system.
    - If the SAP standard system has earmarked a security mechanism for specific tasks, then this security mechanism should also be used in change's custom code.
    - In the target system release, in which the application is to be run, the ABAP code shouldn't use any obsolete language elements.

Use of protective mechanisms

The SAP standard system provides companies with various mechanisms to protect their data. For this reason, the security strategies of many companies are based on the knowledge that the mechanisms in the SAP standard systems provide a solid foundation and are not (or should not be) compromised.
These mechanisms include:
- Client/tenant separation
- Identity management
- Roles and authorizations management
- Separation of development, test and production
- Logging of security events

- Update your kernel to the latest security patch level
- Verify any logical file names and file path definitions from the reports RSFILECR or RSFILENA to determine the required changes
- Profile parameter abap/path_normalizartion should be activated (value 1)
- Paths must be normalized (see SAP note 1497003 for normalizing file paths) if authorization object S_DATASET is used
- Paths must be normalized if table SPTH contains any entries
- If the user interface allows input of logical file names then define aliases for the logical file names being used

1. As part of change review process the implementation's design has to be verified to against the the following properties:
    - During processing of input, a sufficient plausibility check must normally be carried out. This is referred to as “input validation”. Input validation not only provides basic security protection (since control characters and special characters are ineffective in most data fields and can be removed) but it also improves the data quality in general. Input validation should be implemented in such a way that the inputs are compared with a list of permitted values, that is, using the “allowlist filter” approach.
    - Special care should be taken if user input is mixed with control characters or language elements (semantics) and the result is then processed or executed as a whole. In this case, all the control characters in the data, which are relevant in the context, must be rendered harmless. This operation is referred to as “output encoding” or “sanitisation” depending on the output context.
      The implementation of the following measures in particular should be validated:
      - Indirection: The execution of critical code should be decoupled as much as possible from input
      - Plausibility: Range checks, allowlists and/or denylists should be used to restrict the input's value range to plausible values.
      - Context validation: Before execution, control logic must run which sufficiently check the execution authorization of the program, user and input.
      - Traceability: Consideration should be given to logging the execution of sensitive business logic for the user's context, execution time, and input sufficiently.
      - Equivalence: For dynamically executed code, the same level of control  must run as for an equivalent static implementation complying with the in the case of correct static implementation of the code execution.

2. As part of the change testing process all implementations has to be verified for protection against input based attacks as when suitable ABAP techniques being used in the implementation.
    - Directory & file traversal.
    - Operating system command injection.
    - SQL injection.
    - Forceful browsing
    - ABAP code injection.
", IY,"
Prevention of injection vulnerabilities

Injection vulnerabilities refer to situations where a adversary introduces control characters and/or commands via the data channel (input) into an application. A successful attack can have a damaging impact on the scheduled program sequence as a result of unexpected commands.
Depending on the type of injection, an attacker can gain complete control of the affected SAP system. For the ABAP programming language this includes in particular implementations with:
- Access to the file system from file servers, or from the SAP operating systems for exchanges, or for processing of data takes place. With the number of interfaces (applications), the risk increases for each individual interface of receiving compromised data for processing, or of generating such data itself through faulty input.

- Using operating system commands via ABAP programs. The system access is carried out in the context of the SAP-system service user. This user necessarily has extensive privileges in the operating system. Considering the resulting overall risk, ABAP code that executes operating system commands should receive special protection.

- Using dynamic ABAP language features and database access. The options for using dynamic ABAP programming and access to databases have many uses. However, they are also associated with particular risks. If dynamic programming is necessary, these risks must be accounted for by the developer through the use of special protective measures.

Activate the table logging in the profile parameter rec/client. It is recommended to set this parameter to log from all clients within your SAP environment.

As a rule of thumb, choose tables that are either classified with the highest protection level or choose tables depending on the criticality of data found in them.

Alerts can be configured when a certain event occurs or a threshold is reached, this helps automate the review process of table logging and reduces workload from administrators. Sending logs to a central location helps to achieve setting up alerts.
