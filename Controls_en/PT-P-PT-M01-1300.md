## Description

Extended Access Management (EAM) for SAP is intended to enable audit-proof emergency deployments in productive clients of the production systems. This requires that
- the AddOn EAM for SAP is always kept up to date in order to promptly fix possible security vulnerabilities in the AddOn
- all administrative access is encrypted, e.g. to prevent eavesdropping on administrators' passwords


## Implementation

1. Ensure that EAM updates are installed regularly and promptly.

2. Ensure that administrative access to the system is exclusively encrypted, e.g. using HTTPS.


## Verification of control

1. Check that EAM updates are installed promptly after release.

2. Check that administrative access within the framework of EAM can only be encrypted.
- Access e.g. via http://kwp.sap.swm.de:8000/sap/bc/bsp/ibbj/eam_confirm/bsp_0100.htm must not be possible.
