## Description

Extended Access Management (EAM) for SAP should enable audit-proof emergency deployments in productive clients of the production systems. This requires the Security Audit Log (SAL) to be active and correctly configured.


## Implementation

1. Make sure that the Security Audit Log (SAL) is active.

2. Make sure that a static filter exists for the EAM_* users.

3. Make sure that all relevant entries are logged for the EAM_* users.

4. Make sure that the Security Audit Log (SAL) can write sufficiently large log files.


## Verification of control

1. Check that the Security Audit Log (SAL) is active.

2. Check that a static filter exists for the EAM_* users.

3. Check that all relevant entries are logged for the EAM_* users.

4. Check that the Security Audit Log (SAL) can write sufficiently large log files.
