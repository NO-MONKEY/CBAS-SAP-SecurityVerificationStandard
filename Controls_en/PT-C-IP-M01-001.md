## Description

Implementing custom code in the organization should have a defined change management process. This enables organizations to determine whether custom applications should be used as a replacement to existing applications or removed from the organization.

## Implementation

A standard and defined change management process should cover the controls, defined below, when delivering or handling custom applications that will be, or already, integrated with the organizations SAP ecosystem(1).

(1) - This can be amended to the organizations change management if exists

## Verification of Control

- [ ] Implementing policies that clearly define the installation of custom applications
- [ ] Modifying custom code to be limited and only done when necessary
- [ ] Changes are tested to avoid any impact on operations
- [ ] Installation and removal of custom applications properly documented and tracked
- [ ] A Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) defined when customizing, changing, developing, and integrating application
