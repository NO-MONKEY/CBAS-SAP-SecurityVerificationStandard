## Description

Extended Access Management (EAM) for SAP is intended to enable audit-proof emergency operations in productive clients of the production systems. This requires, among other things, that the steps actually performed ideally match the planned steps but do not exceed them.  


## Implementation

1. Ensure that emergency operations are linked to an incident ticket via EAM.

2. Make sure that emergency interventions via EAM in which more transactions/programs were used than initially specified are documented in the incident ticket.

3. Ensure that the assignment of EAM users to natural persons is documented in an audit-proof manner.


## Verification of control

1. Check that assignments are linked to an incident ticket via EAM.

2. Check those deployments via EAM where deviations have been identified to ensure that they are plausible and have been adequately documented in the incident ticket.

3. Check that the list of all currently assigned EAM users is protected against unauthorized access and stored in an audit-proof manner.
