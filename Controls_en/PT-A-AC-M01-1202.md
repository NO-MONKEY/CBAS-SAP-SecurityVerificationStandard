## Description

LNW-Soft Proactive Management System offers an authorization concept for both application users (admins) and interface users.
As these are users with far-reaching authorizations due to their function, a strict separation of functions including restriction of authorizations should be implemented; i.e. authorizations for user administration are usually not required for creating backups, for example.


## Implementation

1. Implement an authorization concept for users of the LNW-Soft PMS components according to the principle of least privilege (need to know/least privilege)

2. Implement an authorization concept for LNW-Soft PMS interface users in the SAP systems according to the principle of least privilege (need to know/least privilege)


## Verification of control

1. Check the configured authorizations in the LNW-Soft PMS user administration.

2. Check the authorizations of the LNW-Soft PMS interface users in the SAP systems.
