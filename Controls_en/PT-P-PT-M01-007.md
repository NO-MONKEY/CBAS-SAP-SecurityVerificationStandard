## Description

Security Audit Logs (SAL) are important to be activated and properly configured throughout the entire SAP environment. This help security teams identify and detect potential threats that might affect their environment.

## Implementation

It is important to activate and properly configure the UME properties pertaining to security audit logs. The following parameters help to do so:

- ume.secaudit.get_object_name = TRUE
- ume.secaudit.log_actor = TRUE
- ume.logon.security_policy.log_client_hostaddress = TRUE
- ume.logon.security_policy.log_client_hostname = FALSE (requires DNS lookup, which impacts system performance)
- enable.xml.hardener = TRUE

It is recommended to change the level of information being logged according to the protection needs of the application. The minimal severity level should be set to *"Info"*.

## Verification of Control

- Verify that security audit logs UME properties are configured
- Verify what is being logged by logging into the Netweaver Administrator and then navigate to -> Troubleshooting -> Logs and Traces -> Log Configuration, from Show filed choose 'Logging Categories'
- Verify the log level settings for the severity level to be logged.
