      "Description": "\nAccess & Authorization\n\nABAP uses a mostly explicit authorization model. This means that an authorization check only takes place if a program carries out the check explicitly itself. In other words: If there is no explicit authorization check in the code, there is no check as to whether a user is actually authorized.\nIn custom-developed code, authorization checks are frequently overlooked. This means that the authorization concept has no effect. This leads to compliance infringements, which can have serious consequences in the event of an audit. For this reason, it is critically important that authorization checks are carried out in custom developments by the programs themselves wherever necessary, and that all authorization checks are also correctly programmed from a formal perspective.\nIn addition to the lack of authorization checks, the structuring of program components can also influence the viability of the authorization concept. For example, you should query how executable modules are comprised under the assumption that interface authorizations are not, or can't be assigned granular for the exposed business functionality.\nAuthorization checks are typically the most frequent security error in ABAP custom developments.\n",
      "Implementation": "\n1. The specification of the change includes a concise description of the authorization requirement adjustments according to the change.\n2. As part of code change review process all custom code has to be checked to carry that:\n  - All authorization checks using the SAP standard mechanisms. This typically means that, either:\n    - the command AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT or\n    - a module, which has been specially developed for checking a specific authorization (such as the SAP function module 'AUTHORITY_CHECK_DATASET'),\n    - or an access declaration by the Data Access Control (DAC) language for Core Data Services (CDS) must be used.\n  - All direct executable modules implement explicit access restrictions at the execution start checking on user permissions to start the module\n  - Before the command CALL TRANSACTION is carried out, an authorization check should take place to ensure that the current user is actually authorized to start the transaction. In case a transaction is called with the attempt of only providing limited access to the transaction's functionality, for example with predefined selection values and the addition SKIP FIRST SCREEN it can be reasonable not to carry out an authorization check for user permissions of starting the transaction, as this may requires unnecessary high privileges for the user.\n  - The implementation verifies the user's authorization as close as possible to the execution of the protected business function.\n  - The implementation handles the result of the verification of user's authorizations to permit legitimate access and execution and prohibit other by the verification of return codes like sy-subrc and authorization exceptions according to the checks implementation.\n",

      "Description": "\nPrevention of injection vulnerabilities\n\nInjection vulnerabilities refer to situations where a adversary introduces control characters and/or commands via the data channel (input) into an application. A successful attack can have a damaging impact on the scheduled program sequence as a result of unexpected commands.\nDepending on the type of injection, an attacker can gain complete control of the affected SAP system. For the ABAP programming language this includes in particular implementations with:\n- Access to the file system from file servers, or from the SAP operating systems for exchanges, or for processing of data takes place. With the number of interfaces (applications), the risk increases for each individual interface of receiving compromised data for processing, or of generating such data itself through faulty input.\n\n- Using operating system commands via ABAP programs. The system access is carried out in the context of the SAP-system service user. This user necessarily has extensive privileges in the operating system. Considering the resulting overall risk, ABAP code that executes operating system commands should receive special protection.\n\n- Using dynamic ABAP language features and database access. The options for using dynamic ABAP programming and access to databases have many uses. However, they are also associated with particular risks. If dynamic programming is necessary, these risks must be accounted for by the developer through the use of special protective measures.\n",
      "Implementation": "\n1. As part of change review process the implementation's design has to be verified to against the the following properties:\n    - During processing of input, a sufficient plausibility check must normally be carried out. This is referred to as \u201cinput validation\u201d. Input validation not only provides basic security protection (since control characters and special characters are ineffective in most data fields and can be removed) but it also improves the data quality in general. Input validation should be implemented in such a way that the inputs are compared with a list of permitted values, that is, using the \u201callowlist filter\u201d approach.\n    - Special care should be taken if user input is mixed with control characters or language elements (semantics) and the result is then processed or executed as a whole. In this case, all the control characters in the data, which are relevant in the context, must be rendered harmless. This operation is referred to as \u201coutput encoding\u201d or \u201csanitisation\u201d depending on the output context.\n      The implementation of the following measures in particular should be validated:\n      - Indirection: The execution of critical code should be decoupled as much as possible from input\n      - Plausibility: Range checks, allowlists and/or denylists should be used to restrict the input's value range to plausible values.\n      - Context validation: Before execution, control logic must run which sufficiently check the execution authorization of the program, user and input.\n      - Traceability: Consideration should be given to logging the execution of sensitive business logic for the user's context, execution time, and input sufficiently.\n      - Equivalence: For dynamically executed code, the same level of control  must run as for an equivalent static implementation complying with the in the case of correct static implementation of the code execution.\n\n2. As part of the change testing process all implementations has to be verified for protection against input based attacks as when suitable ABAP techniques being used in the implementation.\n    - Directory & file traversal.\n    - Operating system command injection.\n    - SQL injection.\n    - Forceful browsing\n    - ABAP code injection.\n",

      "Implementation": "\nA network device acting as a rogue application servers can pose a high risk to the organization if communication is allowed to legitimate application servers.\n\nAccess control lists (ACLs) must be configured for the message server to contain and defend against attacks on the trust relationship between legitimate application servers.\n\n- ACL file should not contain an entry for to allow all hosts (i.e. HOST=* is critical)\n- Split ports on message server for internal (1) and external communication (2)\n- Profile parameter rdisp/msserv_internal defines the internal ports to use\n- Block communication from external to the port defined in profile parameter rdisp/msserv_internal\n- Deny external monitoring of the message server though setting the profile parameter ms/monitor=0\n- Deny external administration of the message server though setting the profile parameter ms/admin_port=0\n\n(1) - Internal communication is for communication between different application serves in the organization\n\n(2) - External communication is for communication with the users/clients\n",
