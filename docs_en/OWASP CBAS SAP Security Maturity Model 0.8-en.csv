Rogue application servers can pose a high risk to the organization if communication is allowed to other application servers.

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are configured for the message server to mitigate and deny rogue traffic.

- [ ] ACL file should not contain an entry for to allow all hosts (i.e. HOST=* is critical)
- [ ] Split ports on message server for internal (1) and external communication (2)
- [ ] Profile parameter rdisp/msserv_internal defines the internal ports to use
- [ ] Block communication from external to the port defined in profile parameter rdisp/msserv_internal
- [ ] Deny external monitoring of the message server though setting the profile parameter ms/monitor=0
- [ ] Deny external administration of the message server though setting the profile parameter ms/admin_port=0

(1) - Internal communication is for communication between different application serves in the organization

(2) - External communication is for communication with the users/clients

Securing malicious or unrecognized access to the application servers through the message server is critical to maintaining the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of different requests between application servers.
